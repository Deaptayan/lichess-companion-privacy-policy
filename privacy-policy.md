  <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
  <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

  <h4>Personal Data</h4>
  <p>While using Our Service, We may ask You to provide Us with certain personally identifiable information, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Usage Data</li>
    <li><strong>Lichess OAuth Access Token</strong> (used to authenticate with the Lichess API)</li>
    <li><strong>Last Searched Team Name</strong> (stored locally in your browser)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Usage Data</h4>
  <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your browser type and version</li>
    <li>Pages or features accessed within the extension</li>
    <li>Timestamps of feature use</li>
    <li>Local storage values for session and preferences (e.g., last searched team)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>OAuth Access Token:</strong> The extension uses a secure OAuth 2.0 authorization flow provided by Lichess to allow You to log in. The token is stored securely in `chrome.storage.local` and is only used for authorized Lichess API access (e.g., user studies, tournaments, and profile information). It is not transmitted to any third-party server.</p>
  <p><strong>Team Search History:</strong> To improve user experience, the last searched team name is saved locally for easier re-access during your session.</p>

  <h3>Use of Your Personal Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain our Service, including to monitor usage and deliver key features.</li>
    <li>To manage user login sessions using the Lichess OAuth Token.</li>
    <li>To remember last search history locally to personalize your experience.</li>
    <li>To communicate important updates if needed.</li>
    <li>To improve the extension features based on anonymized usage patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
  <p>We do not store personal data on our servers. All tokens and user-specific values are stored locally in your browser and can be removed at any time by logging out or uninstalling the extension.</p>

  <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
  <p>You can delete all locally stored data by using the "Logout" button in the extension, which clears the access token and cached values. Uninstalling the extension will also remove all extension-related data.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We value your data privacy and implement Chrome's secure storage APIs and OAuth best practices to protect your information. However, no internet-based system is 100% secure, and use is at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our Service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated revision date.</p>
